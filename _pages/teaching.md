My interest in engineering developed at a young age when I took apart the VCR. To encourage me, but leave the home functioning, my parents bought me Lego blocks where I would spend countless hours imagining, constructing, and discovering. These early experiences led to me pursuing part of my high school diploma at the Ontario Science Centre Science School, where I got the unique opportunity to tinker with public science exhibits and develop my science communication skills. 

Beyond my interest and passion for engineering, I have always felt a calling to teach. To me, teaching is a practice that must be continually cultivated. I think of a teacher as someone who is approachable, honest, and relatable to the learners. Fostering a welcoming environment as a teacher is important to me as it can positively impact the learning process, enhance the quality of the learning that happens, and be a motivation to the learners themselves [1]. To cultivate my teaching acumen, I have continually sought out diverse opportunities. So far, my teaching experiences are based on: 	

●	During my undergraduate and master’s, I developed and instructed multi-day outreach programs for elementary and high school students. These outreach programs focused on exposing students to engineering by providing them with hands-on, problem-solving, and design-based projects coupled with basic fundamental theory. 
●	For two semesters during my master’s, I instructed 2h weekly programming tutorials (30-50 students) for the first-year engineers at Queen’s University.
●	During my 2-year post-graduate fellowship, I mentored several undergraduate students in the engineering science department at the Harvard University.
●	For two semesters during my Ph.D. I held teaching assistantships where I led weekly biomedical physiology labs providing undergraduate students with hands-on experiences involving experimental design, data collection, and data analysis. 
●	For six semesters during my Ph.D., I held convective teaching assistantships working closely with a senior instructor developing midterms and exams. I was continually invited to give guest lectures on exoskeletons and robotics every semester. 

In my experience engineering pedagogy can be heavily lecture-based theoretical coursework paired with only a few hands-on laboratory courses. As a result, there can be a disconnect between the knowledge acquired in the classroom to relevance to practical applications [2]. Often only the students who are involved in extracurricular projects, internships, or research get hands-on experience making the connection between theory and practice. For me, learning is about getting the tools and experiences one needs to integrate critical thinking and agile problem-solving into novel engineering problems. I believe that providing students experiences where they can apply theory to practice early on in the curriculum is the best way to maximize understanding of learned engineering principles and instill the problem-solving acumen students will need in their future.

My current teaching philosophy is to create and foster an environment in which students can learn deeply. This involves five teaching concepts: (1) student engagement, (2) fostering collaboration, (3) self-directed learning, (4) tools, and (5) frequent feedback.

Student engagement. As an educator, I strive to incorporate experiential learning practices, a philosophy of learning by doing, to promote engagement in my learners. By fostering an environment that provides engaging, relevant, and interesting experiences the learning itself can be deeper and more meaningful [3]. For example, during the physiology labs that I was teaching, I had students work in teams using novel data acquisition tools. Having students work together while using relevant tools to solve problems created active engagement and allowed the learners to develop a deeper understanding of the concepts. As a result, the learners are more likely to retain that knowledge and apply it appropriately in novel situations [4]. 

Fostering collaboration. I believe that engineers must learn how to work collaboratively to succeed. One method I have been working on incorporating into my teaching practice is a flipped classroom. For example, I would like to reshape a theory-heavy undergraduate course (e.g. dynamics) where the fundamental principles are provided to the students remotely via video instruction and class time is used for engaging and collaborating with peers to solve hands-on problems. Such an approach can provide increased peer-to-peer interaction and deeper engagement with the material while promoting collaboration to achieve a common goal [5]. By fostering collaboration within the classroom, the learns become teachers amongst themselves. 

Self-directed learning. I consider myself a successful teacher when I help my students become self-directed learners. I believe that self-directed learners have better chances for success in the engineering workplace [6]. When I was instructing weekly programming tutorials, I curated puzzles at the start of the tutorials. The puzzles encouraged agile thinking and allowed students to pursue innovative and unique strategies while pushing them beyond their current level of understanding. I found that students not only enjoyed this but developed their own reasoning and used critical thinking to propose solutions to the puzzles.  

Tools. I believe that it is critical for engineering students to get hands-on experiences with relevant tools. I keep up to date on the latest technology used in my field of research and strongly believe in bringing these tools into the classroom. Not only is this a form of motivation for the learners, but technology can help make the link to relevance outside of the classroom [7]. Currently, I am developing a course that utilizes the latest methods of deep learning to study human biomechanics. With this course, I aim to provide novel and unique learning experiences for the future generation of engineers. 

Feedback. I aim to help students know what they don’t know to help focus learning. I believe that students need appropriate feedback from the teacher on performance to most benefit from courses [8]. In fact, frequent detailed feedback is one of the strongest correlations with a learner’s success outside of the classroom [9]. One of my teaching principles is to be open and approachable to my students. I do this to not only cultivate a good learning environment but to encourage students to be open with me about their learning. In lab-based courses, I have asked for verbal feedback after each lab to help in improving the labs, and in larger classroom settings, I have implemented simple online polls to encourage the sharing of what students may be struggling with. I believe that quick feedback is an important tool for me as an educator to gauge the learning, as well as to increase the success of the learners.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
