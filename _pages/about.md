I am currently a [Faculty Lecturer](https://bme.ubc.ca/?directory=pawel-kudzia) in the School of Biomedical Engineering (SBME) at the University of British Columbia. As a specialist in bio-mech-engineering, I combine biomechanics, engineering, and data-driven modelling to push the boundaries of current technology. I am passionately dedicated to education and mentorship. I believe in empowering my students with knowledge, fostering their creativity, and guiding them to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.\
