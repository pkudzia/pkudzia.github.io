I am a PhD Candidate in Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. I currently work with Professor Max Donelan where we develop novel scientific experiments that help us understand and quantify the limits of our nervous systems control of the forces beneath our feet. Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as a researcher at the  John A. Paulson School of Engineering at Harvard University in Boston, USA. At Harvard I was part of larger engineering team. We tested the effects of a novel exoskeleton assisting stroke survivors with walking. The cumulation of some of this work was published in Science. I obtained my Masters of Applied Science and Bachelors of Engineering from Queen's University in Kingston, Canada.
