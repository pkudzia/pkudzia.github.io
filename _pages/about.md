I am currently a [Faculty Lecturer](https://bme.ubc.ca/?directory=pawel-kudzia) in the School of Biomedical Engineering (SBME) at the University of British Columbia. As a specialist in bio-mech-engineering, I combine biomechanics, engineering, and data-driven modelling to push the boundaries of current technology. I am passionately dedicated to education and mentorship. I believe in empowering my students with knowledge, fostering their creativity, and guiding them to apply theoretical concepts in real-world scenarios.

My primary research interests are in developing innovative solutions to augment, restore, and deepen our understanding of human mobility. I love developing physical experiments, working with data, and leveraging machine learning to gain new insights. My approach is not just theoretical but also deeply rooted in practical applications, aiming to bring significant advancements in this field. I received my PhD in Engineering Science and Physiology from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada were I worked in the [Locomotion Lab](https://www.sfu.ca/locomotionlab/) with Professor Max Donelan. We developed experiments to help us better understand and quantify the limits of our nervous systems control of the forces beneath our feet (external forces) (see : [Research Work](portfolio) ). Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as an engineering researcher at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering at Harvard University in Boston, USA and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering . At Harvard I was part of larger engineering team in the [Biodesign Lab](https://biodesign.seas.harvard.edu/) supervised by Professor Conor Walsh. My work involved quantifying the rehabilitative effects of a novel gait assisting exoskeleton aiding stroke survivors. The cumulation of some of this work was [published](publications) in *Science Translational Medicine*. Prior to working at Harvard and the Wyss Institute , I obtained my Masters of Applied Science and Bachelors of Engineering from [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca) in Kingston, Canada where I studied Mechanical Engineering with a focus on biomechanics. 

Outside the lab and classroom, I immerse myself in the world of endurance sports, participating in trail ultra-marathons and ski mountaineering. These activities are more than hobbies; they empower me personally and professionally, enriching my scientific inquiry and creativity.
