I am a PhD Candidate in Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. I currently work in the Locomotion Lab with Professor Max Donelan where we develop  scientific experiments that help us understand and quantify the limits of our nervous systems control of the forces beneath our feet. Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as a researcher at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering at Harvard University in Boston, USA. There was part of larger engineering team in the Biodeisign Lab supervised by Professor Conor Walsh. My work involved quantifying the rehabilitative effects of a novel exoskeleton assisting stroke survivors with walking. The cumulation of some of this work was [published](publications) in *Science Translational Medicine*. I obtained my Masters of Applied Science and Bachelors of Engineering from [Queen's University](queensu.ca)  in Kingston, Canada. I have [teaching](teaching) experience in a range...
