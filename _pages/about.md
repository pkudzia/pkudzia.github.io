I am a PhD Candidate in Engineering Science at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. I currently work in the [Locomotion Lab](https://sfulocomotionlab.github.io/#intro) with Professor Max Donelan where we develop experiments to help us better understand and quantify the limits of our nervous systems control of the forces beneath our feet (external forces). Prior to pursuing my PhD, I worked as an engineering researcher at the John A. Paulson School of Engineering at Harvard University in Boston, USA. There I was part of larger engineering team in the [Biodesign Lab](https://biodesign.seas.harvard.edu/) supervised by Professor Conor Walsh. My work involved quantifying the rehabilitative effects of a novel gait assisting exoskeleton aiding stroke survivors. The cumulation of some of this work was [published](publications) in *Science Translational Medicine*. Prior to working at Harvard, I obtained my Masters of Applied Science and Bachelors of Engineering from [Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca) in Kingston, Canada where I studied Mechanical Engineering with a focus on biomechanics. Outside of research I enjoy sports such as mountaineering, skiing, running, and cycling as well as other activities such as cooking, camping, and hosting dinner socials.
